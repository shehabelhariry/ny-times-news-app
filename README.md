# NY Times News App

## Design Choices:

- Use Vite - React template.
- Use AntD for UI components.
- Use React Router for simple routing.
- Use React Query for http requests and simple State handling.
- Use Jest for unit testing of small functions.
- Use React Testing Library for component testing: (Good to have)

## UI Modifications nice to haves:

- Make the cards in the home page have the same height
- Make the publish date humanly readable

## Running the Project Locally

- Create a `.env` file similar to the `.env.sample` on the root project and replact `sample-value` with a vaid NY Times api key. Go to [this link](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) create an account and an API key.
- Run `npm run dev` the server should be running on `http://localhost:5173/`

# NY Times News App

## Design Choices:

1. Use Vite - React template.
2. Use AntD for UI components.
3. Use React Router for simple routing.
4. Use React Query for http requests and simple State handling.
5. Use Jest for unit testing of small functions.
6. Use React Testing Library for component testing: (Good to have)

## UI Modifications nice to haves:

1. Make the cards in the home page have the same height
2. Make the publish date humanly readable

## Running the Project Locally

1. run `npm install`
2. create a `.env` file similar to the `.env.sample` on the root project and replact `sample-value` with a vaid NY Times api key. Go to [this link](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) create an account and an API key.
3. run `npm run dev`
